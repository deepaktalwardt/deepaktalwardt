## :wave: Hi, I'm Deepak. 
🤖 I'm a passionate robotics and self-driving car engineer with significant experience in using images and 3D point clouds for Computer Vision tasks. 

🍀 Most recently, I worked as the Robotics Software Intern at [FarmWise Labs](https://farmwise.io), where I developed computer vision-based stereo-imaging algorithms to estimate crop heights using camera images and enabled accurate localization of crops required for precision agriculture. I also brought up the 3D Time-of-Flight (ToF) cameras across the fleet and enabled estimation of crop-bed planes using point clouds from these 3D ToF cameras, improving the weeding quality of agriculture robots. 

🚘 Starting in August 2020, I will be working as the Software Engineering Intern at [DeepMap](https://www.deepmap.ai/), working with point cloud and camera image data to build HD maps for self-driving vehicles. 

🎓 I am currently pursuing my Master's in Computer Engineering at San Jose State University and using my projects and research to dive deep into the self-driving car space. I graduated from UC Berkeley in 2015 with a focus on Mechatronics and Control systems. You can view more details on my portfolio: www.deepaktalwar.me
