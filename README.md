## :wave: Hi, I'm Deepak. 
🤖 I'm a passionate robotics and self-driving car engineer with significant experience in using images and 3D point clouds for Computer Vision tasks. 

🍀 I have been working as a Robotics Software Engineer at [FarmWise Labs](https://farmwise.io), where I have worked across the Perception stack. I developed computer vision-based stereo-imaging algorithms to estimate crop heights using camera images and enabled accurate localization of crops required for precision agriculture. I also brought up the 3D Time-of-Flight (ToF) cameras across the fleet and enabled estimation of crop-bed planes using point clouds from these 3D ToF cameras, improving the weeding quality of agriculture robots. Additionally, I have also worked on bring-up of cameras for the next gen product. This involved writing low-level driver code and interfacing with multiple SDKs to achieve high throughput performance at high frame-rates.

🚘 Previously, I worked as a Software Engineering Intern at [DeepMap](https://www.linkedin.com/company/deepmapinc/) (Acquired by NVIDIA), where I worked with point cloud and camera image data to generate real-time statistics for data collection jobs for HD map construction. 

🎓 I completed my Master's in Computer Engineering at San Jose State University and using my projects and research to dive deep into the self-driving car space. I graduated from UC Berkeley in 2015 with a focus on Mechatronics and Control systems. You can view more details on my portfolio: www.deepaktalwar.me
